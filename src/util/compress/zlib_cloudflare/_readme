Note:

1) 

inlude\util\compress\zlib-cloudflare\zconf.h have an extra line added:

    #define Z_PREFIX

to add "z_" prefix to all zlib functions. This is necessary to avoid linking conflicts with an original zlib.

2) The currect version of Cloudflare zlib is based on outdated zlib, it missses some necessary redefines. 
See "_patch" file. It should be checked / applied after upgrading Cloudflare zlib in the current directory.


3) zutil.h also have "z_errmsg" symbol that conflicts with zlib, need to be renamed to "zcf_errmsg" for example in the .h/.c files.
