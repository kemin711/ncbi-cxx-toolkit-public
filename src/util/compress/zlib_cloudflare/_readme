Porting notes:

- Provided '_patch' shows basic changes agains '_gitversion' of the repository only, and not full.
  It is just a guidelines what should be checked/changed after updating versions.

- All '.h' files in the 'include/util/compress/zlib_cloudflare/' were renamed, added '_cf' suffix 
  to avoid conflicts with zlib on some platforms, that could pick up such headers instead of original zlib's 'zconf/zlin/zutil(.h)'.

-  !!! ALL Cloudflare zlib .[ch] files should be changed to include renamed files only.

- 'inlude/util/compress/zlib-cloudflare/zconf_cf.h' have an extra lines added:

  first:
	#include <ncbiconf.h>

  second:
	#define Z_PREFIX

  to add "z_" prefix to all zlib functions. This is necessary to avoid linking conflicts with an original zlib.

- The currect version of Cloudflare zlib is based on outdated zlib 1.2.8, that missses some necessary redefines.
  See "_patch" file. It should be checked/applied after upgrading Cloudflare zlib in the current directory.


- 'inlude/util/compress/zlib-cloudflare/zutil_cf.h' also have 'z_errmsg' symbol that conflicts with zlib, 
  so need to be renamed to something else, like 'zcf_errmsg', in the .h/.c files.
